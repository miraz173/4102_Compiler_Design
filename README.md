# 4102_Compiler_Design
Designing a compiler for a programming language.
In the Compiler Design course (CS 4102), the primary goal is to understand the concepts, algorithms, and methods involved in designing and implementing a compiler for a programming language. A compiler translates high-level source code into lower-level machine code or intermediate code for execution. This course requires understanding various stages involved in the compilation process, such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, code generation, and optimization.

2_Advanced_Compiler contains many functionality not present in 1a or 1b. Many functions are yet to be completed.
